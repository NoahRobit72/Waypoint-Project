# Waypoints-Project

This project is an iphone application that simulates placeing waypoints for a robot to follow

The paths are continous which means the start point is also the end point

To delete a point, simply click an existing point and the point will be deleted.

If you delete a start/finish point, the program will assign a new start/endpoint to the next waypoint.
